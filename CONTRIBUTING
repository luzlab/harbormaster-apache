# CONTRIBUTING

To get your code landed quickly and cleanly, please follow these guidelines:

1. All existing tests should pass.  Run `npm test` and `npm run test:e2e` to run the test suites.
2. New functions should have accompanying unit tests.
3. New routes and views should have accompanying end-to-end (e2e) tests.
4. Code should adhere to the style of code already in Harbormaster.
5. Create a branch with the structure: [type of work]/[any issue no. to reference]/[title]
6. Submit your work as a PR on the `next` branch.

Cheers!
